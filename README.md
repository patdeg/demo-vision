Demo of Google Vision API on App Engine
=======================================

How To Get Started
------------------
In the file app.yaml, replace the application name (here deglondemo) with your App Engine project

How it works
------------

Use this web application on your desktop or your phone to test the Google Vision API. 
You can load in the server a local image or take a picture on your phone. Then the 
application will run some of the annotations (Labels, Landmarks, Logos, Text) and 
show the results on the user screen. The annotations and some of the meta-data will
be streamed in real-time into BigQuery.
